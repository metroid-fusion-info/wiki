title: Cheddar Bay
---

The name "Cheddar Bay" comes from the Evir "guarding" the item and an association with [Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lobster#/media/File:Red_Lobster_-_Biscuits_(6022841688).jpg). 

This room is sometimes also known as "Security Access", not to be confused with the [actual Security Access](../security-access/).
